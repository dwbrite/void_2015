...
The universe is silent.
[Chapter 0]: ...
What’s that?
A faint murmur masquerades amongst the silence.
It’s you.
...
But wait--who *are* you...?
You have no memories.
You just...exist.
You just...are.
You have no beginning nor ending.
No past nor future.
Just the present.
Just now.
...
You: Wh...what do we do now?
I’m afraid that’s not my decision.
It’s up to you.
[Chapter 1]: What *do* we do now?
	> !!! Ponder my existence. 
		...
		Just...think.
		… 
		Why do you exist?
		What are you here for?
		Or...is there even a reason for your existence?
			> Of course.
				What is it?
					> To live a successful life.
						There *is* no life here.
						It’s just you.
						And you just...are.
						You: So, what do we do now? // I don't think we should shove it on their face so hard. It should be very subtle, but noticeable. 

// Oh, yes, this was from the competition. Which is basically why we included the line.
						Who are you?
							> !!!
					> To ensure the happiness of others.
						There’s nobody here.
						Just you.
						!!!
					> !!! To devote myself to some other cause.
					> !!! To pave the way to the future.
						The future doesn’t exist.
						It’s never been anything but now.

						!!!	
			> Nope.
				Your existence is meaningless.
				...
				At least...not intrinsically.
				!!! mention opportunities
				
	> !!! Explore.
		There’s nothing here.
		Nowhere to go...
			> Let’s explore anyways.
				You find nothing.
				Because...that’s all there is.
				Does...anything exist?
					> Umm…yes?
						Do...you exist?
							> Yes?
								Of course you exist.
								You always have existed.
								You always will exist.
								[Chapter 1];
							> …
								You never existed.
								You never have.	
								[Chapter -1];
					> I...I guess not…
						...
						Nothing exists.
						Nothing at all.
						[Chapter -1];
			> Nevermind.
				

	> !!! Rest.
		You doze off for eternity.
		And yet, you awake.
		...
		A familiar silence permeates the universe.

Meanwhile, in another dimension...
