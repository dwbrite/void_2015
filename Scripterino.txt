[Chapter 0]: 
...
The universe is silent.
...
What’s that?
A faint murmur masquerades amongst the silence.
It’s you.
...
But wait--who *are* you...?
You have no memories.
You just...exist.
You just...are.
You have no beginning nor ending.
No past nor future.
Just the present.
Just now.
...
You: Wh...what do we do now?
I’m afraid that’s not my decision.
It’s up to you.
[Chapter 1]: 
...
Well?
> Why do I exist?
	...
	Just think for a moment.
	...
	What could you possibly be here for?
	You're here now... So there must be something, right?
	Or is there a reason for your existence at all?
	> Of course.
		Then what is it?
		> I have to live a successful life.
			There *is* no life here.
			It’s just you.
			And you just... are.
			But...
			Who are you?
			> :: (Name)
				Well, (Name)...
				[Chapter 2]
				You can do anything here.
				So what will you do now?
				
		> I must ensure the happiness of others.
			There’s nobody here.
			Just you.
			...
			What do you think that makes me?
			> A piece of my imagination.
				???
			> The embodiment of the Universe.
				???
			> I don't know.
				Well... 
				I am everything, and nothing.

	> Nope.
		Your existence is meaningless.
		...
		But that doesn't mean you can't make your own meaning.
				
> Where am I?
	You are nowhere.
	There is nothing in any direction...
	Except for you...
	> 
		...
		Does anything exist?
		> Don't you exist?
			
			> Yes 
				Of course you exist.
				You always have existed.
				You always will exist.
				[Chapter 1];
				
			> ...
				You don't exist.
				You never have.	
				[Chapter 0];
		
> *Rest*
	You doze off for eternity.
	And yet, you awake.
	...
	A familiar silence permeates the universe.
